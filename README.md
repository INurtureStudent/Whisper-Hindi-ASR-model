# Whisper-Hindi-ASR-model-IIT-Bombay-Internship 
The Whisper Hindi ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model utilizes the KathBath dataset, a comprehensive collection of speech samples in Hindi. Trained on this dataset, Whisper employs advanced deep learning techniques to accurately transcribe spoken Hindi into text. Its architecture harnesses the power of neural networks to recognize and interpret the nuances of the Hindi language, including regional accents and dialects. Whisper stands out for its efficiency and accuracy, offering a reliable solution for converting spoken Hindi into written text across various applications, from transcription services to voice-enabled interfaces.
# Word Error Rate(WER)
Word Error Rate (WER) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. It measures the disparity between the transcribed output generated by the ASR system and the reference or ground truth transcription.
WER is calculated as the ratio of the total number of errors (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) required to align the transcribed text with the reference text, divided by the total number of words in the reference text.
WER provides a comprehensive assessment of the accuracy of ASR systems, taking into account both misrecognitions and omissions of words in the transcription. Lower WER values indicate higher accuracy, with a perfect score of 0 indicating an exact match between the transcribed and reference texts.
WER is a widely used evaluation metric in the field of speech recognition, providing valuable insights into the performance and quality of ASR models across different languages and applications.
